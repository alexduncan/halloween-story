The story is about a little girl who is a witch, and it’s fair to say that it’s more sweet than spooky. 
Her name is Kate, and her school mates think she is rather odd, and don’t really believe that she can do magic. 
She’s afraid of Halloween, because she thinks they will tease her more than usual, 
but in fact she has quite a few useful tricks and treats up her sleeve.
