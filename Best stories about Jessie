Since the Halloween is coming, Jessie is on her way to Eggplant 1 with a giant basket. 
In this morning, Jessie spent over 2 hours to dress up like a 5 year old girl.


Jessie finished her work, then she went to washroom. She looked in the mirror, and she saw a huge bald head -- and it was hers.
She was so scared, she was running and screaming, seeking for the exit!
She ran out of the office, and she saw Flora, also bald! 
SHE also saw a pale person! She stood still and realised, that was a ghost looked exactly like her dear old father.
How could Jessie know that was not her dear old father? Correct, her ture real dear old father is still in the air.
