# a spooky halloween story
A spooky tale that has yet to be told...

It was the Saturday before Halloween.
The skies were overcast and the winds were howling.
Bunny is on the way to see her potential new boy friend, and suddently a huge talantura drop on her head
A baby ghost followed Layla to her room
