IT'S A WORKING SATURDAY
PPT slides, coffee, music, seems everything is as perfect as usual
but, A coffee ghost appears, he said, 
Forget your work and have fun!
But the PPT ghost said,
Ya better finish your work first or you will not survive this Halloween!
And then a music ghost said, come with me and I will have you experience the best Halloween ever!
Well, I said, thank you for accompanying me for a weekend workingday. At least I don't feel that lonely. You guys made me hard to choose. How about...
"Party", said the music ghost, "let's have a party".
